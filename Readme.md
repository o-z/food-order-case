## FoodOrder Case project
Project Goal:

"Food Ordering System" that will be a fresh breeze in the industry. 
There is a need for many microservices for this purpose, 
but we will only focus on the "restaurant" and "order" microservices. 
All the endpoints that communicate over HTTP are Restful, and each microservice has its own database/schema.

Project written with java 17 + Spring Boot 2.6.6 Tech:
<b>

- Mysql
- Kafka (refund mechanism)
- Redis (basket locking)
- Flyway
- Docker (with Volumes)
- Scheduler
- Testcontainers
- Open Api
- FeignClient
  </b>

Project Architecture Contents:

- DDD with Hexagonal Architecture
- SAGA Pattern (order rollback)
- Outbox Pattern (order reconciliation)
- Factory pattern (payment methods, rule)

For run project ;

Build : 

Firstly delete module base pom.xml and build. After delete module in module's pom.xml and build
domain,infra. After building all modules, re-add modules to poms and build all project

1. With Docker :
  - Compile project with Java 17
  - Run with Docker comments , go to project folder and run this commands:

    ```
    $ cd order-api
    $ docker build -t order-api-image . 
    $ cd ..
    $ cd restaurant-api
    $ docker build -t restaurant-api-image .
    $ cd .. 
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```
2. With IDE  :
  - Firstly you must be run mysql,kafka,zookeper and redis in docker
  - add your host file
    - 0.0.0.0 zookeeper
    - 0.0.0.0 food-order-kafka
    - 0.0.0.0 food-order-order-mysql
    - 0.0.0.0 food-order-restaurant-mysql
    - 0.0.0.0 food-order-redis
    - 0.0.0.0 restaurant-api
    - 0.0.0.0 order-api

    7. Ä°f rollback failed due to integration or network problem dont forget project have a scheduler job for reconciliation


Project have Open Api you can test it in our browser by visiting http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html ,
http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html
and u can find postman collections in base folder.
